Doggie Daycare
	Woof Gang Doggie Day Care offers a safe environment for monitored interaction with other dogs.

	Woof Gang Doggie Day Care is clean and staffed with well-trained individuals who put your dog’s safety above all else.  Our intimate atmosphere provides individual attention that ensures the needs of each pet are always being met.

	You will go through an initial screening process to ensure that your dog is fit to integrate into Woof Gang Doggie Day Care. Your dog must be spayed or neutered with up-to-date vaccinations for parvo, bordatella, rabies, and DHLP. During your dog’s initial visit he/she will be closely scrutinized.

	If your dog meets socialization requirements and enjoys mixing with other dogs, then chances are they will thrive at doggy daycare.

	Dogs love Woof Gang Doggie Day Care. There’s room to run around, lots of human attention and plenty of canine companionship.  If you work long hours, Woof Gang Doggie Day Care benefits both you and your pet.  Our focus is keeping your dog safe and well.
