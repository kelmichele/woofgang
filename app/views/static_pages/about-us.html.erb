			<h3>Our Story</h3>
			<p>Woof Gang Bakery began in 2007 in Jupiter, Florida. From humble roots, it has grown from a single location, to a multi-state franchise with national expansion opportunities. The simple combination of outstanding service, quality products, a great management team and our franchisees has given Woof Gang Bakery the right recipe for success.</p>

			<p>Our approach to franchising is very simple. <b>Successful franchising is totally built upon successful franchisees. </b>
				We award franchise agreements, and accept locations based on quality not quantity. Not all applicants, but the right applicants. Not all sites, but the right sites.
				Our leadership philosophy is based upon the belief that we should direct, not dominate the franchise system, and that our Franchisees should have a voice and participate in that direction.
