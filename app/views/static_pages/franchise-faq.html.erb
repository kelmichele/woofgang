		<h4>What do I need to apply as a franchisee?</h4>
			<p>The key to continuing the success of Woof Gang Bakery and maintaining our mission is selecting the right people to join our team as franchise owners. We have multiple franchise owners who have diverse backgrounds and business experiences. Many of our owners, however, were once Woof Gang Bakery customers who were attracted by the quality of our products, our vision of service, and our solid support infrastructure.
			A prospective franchisee must be willing to work hard, be committed to excellent customer service, be a team player with a drive to succeed, and control their own financial future.</p>

			<ul>
				<p>As we share our vision with others, we are looking for individuals who demonstrate the following:</p>
				<li>High degree of personal integrity</li>
				<li>Dedication to upholding the Woof Gang Bakery mission</li>
				<li>Entrepreneurial spirit</li>
				<li>Proven ability to motivate and train others</li>
				<li>Devote full-time best efforts to the day-to-day operation of a Woof Gang Bakery store</li>
				<li>Complete a comprehensive training program and be proficient in all aspects of operating a Woof Gang Bakery store</li>
				<li>Financial resources and the ability to manage them</li>
				<li>Provide outstanding customer service</li>
				<li>Active community participant</li>
			</ul>


		<h4>Will I have to be involved in the business full-time?</h4>
			<p>The franchisee's participation, supervision, and their full and exclusive time in daily store operations is essential to building their business.
			For all partnerships, we require the general partner to participate personally in the direct operation of their Woof Gang Bakery store.</p>


		<h4>What operational support does Woof Gang Bakery provide?</h4>
			<p>Want to become a franchisee? Check out these common questions for answers.
			We understand that only through your success is the entire company successful. Our support services start prior to you becoming a Woof Gang Bakery franchisee. We will make sure that your market is right for a successful Woof Gang Bakery store. Then we will start with pre-opening support such as assistance in developing a business plan, site selection assistance, lease negotiation, equipment leases, store fixtures and opening inventory requirements.</p>

			<p>Our support team is committed to providing the assistance that you need to get your business off to a smooth start and keep it performing productively. We will help you train your staff, stock and display your initial inventory, and recommend advertising programs to enhance your market presence. Within the first year of operation you will receive multiple store visits from a member of the support team. Plus, we will always be available should questions arise.</p>

			<p>The Franchise Development Team works with the franchisees in the development of their market. Ultimately, like any small business, the franchisee is responsible for growing their enterprise. The franchise development team will assist and guide a franchisee in their pursuit of development. Along with enterprise training, Woof Gang Bakery provides established processes and technology that will assist in a franchisee’s pursuit to own a successful store.</p>


		<h4>What type of training do you provide?</h4>
			<p>Training is comprised of two segments that prepare franchisees on the operation of the store.
			The first segment is done in a training store. The final segment is done at your new store location with a Woof Gang Bakery field representative on hand to assist.</p>


		<h4> How many employees will I need?</h4>
			<p>Woof Gang Bakery stores are built on the concept that one person can easily manage daily operations, including opening, serving customers, baking treats, stocking, cleaning and closing.
			Of course, peak retail seasons can be bustling, so extra help to provide excellent customer service during those times is highly recommended.</p>


		<h4>Does Woof Gang Bakery help with marketing?</h4>
			<p>We sure do! We understand the importance in creating awareness and building the brand image in each of the communities we serve. Marketing campaigns are developed to support the overall positioning of the Woof Gang Bakery brand. Marketing supports these objectives by assisting franchise owners with implementing their own local advertising, marketing, print and promotions programs.
			New marketing tools and concepts are made available to our franchisees as they are developed.</p>


		<h4>Do all franchises buy products from the same vendors?</h4>
			<p>Yes. One of the benefits of joining an established franchise company is that solid relationships are in place with food distributors, product vendors, printing companies, equipment suppliers and others. Our purchasing department negotiates services and price agreements with approved suppliers and distributors.
			You will be provided the systems and products that are identified as the approved core menu to create brand alignment and to leverage the purchasing power of our company.</p>


		<h4>Do you assist with site selection?</h4>
			<p>We are ready to assist you in locating a site for your Woof Gang Bakery. We have developed site selection criteria you can use as a guideline in locating your new store. While we do not select your site for you, we will be available to consult with you and offer recommendations based on our own site selection experience. We will review your site choices and help you make an evaluation based on building criteria, market area, site characteristics and access.</p>
			<ul>
				<p>We also have real estate guidelines in place:</p>
				<li>High visibility strip mall, approximately 600 to 3000 square feet.</li>
				<li>Sources for strong foot traffic: trade area mix of offices and retail with surrounding upscale residential.</li>
				<li>15,000 or more households with household income above $85,000.</li>
				<li>Strong co-tenancy consisting of high-end retail, daily needs and/or lifestyle centers.</li>
				<li>Minimum of 15,000 vehicles per day along the main frontage road.</li>
			</ul>


		<h4>Do you offer advice on construction?</h4>
			<p>We will work with you to develop a layout to fit the particular characteristics of your site. Our construction personnel can visit your site and offer recommendations for necessary modifications.
